# oop-adventure

This is an interactive text adventure game which has been written using object-oriented programming concepts in C# and .NET 6. 

I followed along the video tutorial which can be found in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/object-oriented-programming-with-c-sharp-17331514/programming-an-object-oriented-text-adventure-game?autoplay=true">LinkedIn Learning</a>

The course provided an overview of the many features of C# that support object-oriented programming, including abstract classes, interfaces, generic types,
command patterns, method overrides and more.
